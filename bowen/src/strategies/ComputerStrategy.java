 * The ComputerStrategy interface defines the contract for implementing automated strategies

 * and executing a move based on its specific decision-making logic.
 * The primary method, makeMove, allows a strategy implementation to interact with the game
 * model, evaluate possible moves, and decide on the best course of action. If no valid moves
 * exist, the strategy indicates that the computer must pass its turn.
 * Implementing classes should encapsulate their specific logic for selecting moves,
 * potentially including heuristics, prioritization, or other decision-making criteria.
